# chess_bot

I tried to make a simple chess bot using the classical mini_max algorithm with pruning. 
We can make it compete with a naive algorithm that just takes pieces when it can with the notebook *arena*.

I'll probably come back later to optimize and increase the performances of this algorithm until it can compete with 1500 ELO on chess.com
